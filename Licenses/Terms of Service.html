<h2>Section 20: Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>
    You agree that any dispute between you and Kadence arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or any Kadence service
    (collectively "disputes") will be governed by the arbitration process below.
</br>
    Governing Law: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Terms of Service and the resolution of any disputes shall be
    governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
</br>
    Informal Dispute Resolution: We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against
    Kadence, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us. We will attempt to resolve your dispute informally
    by contacting you via email. If your dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Kadence may bring forth a
    formal proceeding.
</br>
    We Both Agree to Arbitrate: You and Kadence agree to resolve your dispute through final and binding arbitration, except as
    set forth in the exceptions to arbitration listed below.
</br>
    Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Administration (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial 
    Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United 
    States in the county where you live or work, West Lafayette, Indiana, or any other location we agree to.
</br>
    Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Kadence will not seek its attorney's fees and 
    costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
</br>
    Exceptions to Arbitration: Either you or Kadence may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in West Lafayette
    (IN) or in any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to
    stop unauthorized use or abuse of Kadence services, or infringement of intellectual property rights without engaging in
    arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above.
</br>
    No Class Actions: You may only resolve a dispute with Kadence on behalf of yourself, on an individual basis, and may not bring
    a claim as a plantiff or a member of a class, consolidated or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private
    attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrators are not allowed under this agreement.
</br>
    Judicial Forum for Disputes: Except as otherwise stated by an applicable law, in the event that this agreement to arbitrate is 
    not applicable to your dispute, you and Kadence agree that any other judicial proceeding (aside from small claims cases) will
    be brought in the Federal or State Courts of Tippecanoe County, Indiana. Both you and Kadence consent to personal and venue
    jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.
</br>
    Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
    your use of any Kadence service must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of the action arose. If the claim is 
    not filed within the window mentioned above, your claim will be barred forever.
</p>
<h2>Section 21: General Terms</h2>
<p>
    Except as otherwise stated herein, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and 
    Kadence regarding the use and access of any Kadnece service, and these terms supersede and replace any prior oral or written 
    agreement or understanding between you and Kadence regarding any Kadence service or Kadence content.
</br>
    We will notify you before any material change to these terms is enacted, and give you a chance to review the updated Terms of
    Service before continuing to use any Kadence service. Once you use any Kadence service after the opportunity to review the
    updated Terms of Service, you are accepting these updated terms.
</br>
    If the whole or any portion of these terms is found by a court of a competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for 
    any reason, that portion or whole will be enforced to the maximum extend permissable and the other portions will continue to be 
    enforced to their full extent. 
</br>
    You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these terms, by operation of the Law or otherwise, without Kadence's prior express written
    consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these terms without such consent will be null. Kadence and its developers may
    freely transfer these terms without restriction. These terms, subject to the foregoing, will bind and inure to the benefit of
    the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.
</br>
    Any notices or other communications provided by Kadence under these terms, including those regarding updates or modifications
    to these terms, will be given via (1) email or (2) a posting to any Kadence service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt
    on the message will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
</br>
    Kadence's failure to any right or provision of these terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver
    of such right or provision will only be effective if the waiving is in writing and signed by an authorized representative for Kadence.
    Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without 
    prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
</p>
<h2>Section 22: Additional Terms</h2>
<p>
    Additional terms and conditions ("additional terms") may apply to specific Kadence services. In the event that these additional
    terms contradict or otherwise conflict with these terms, the additional terms will control.
</p>
